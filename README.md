# Hello, my name is Dmitry Khodanitsky! 👋

## About me

I am a beginner frontend developer, I am studying on the [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/) platform. Here I publish my educational projects that I do on my own during the training process. Each project undergoes code review with a mentor and refactoring to improve the quality of the code.

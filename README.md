# Hello, my name is Dmitry Khodanitsky! 👋

## About me
Hi! I'm a beginner front-end developer. I completed a course at [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/) and worked on several projects, from console utilities in Node.js to a full-fledged instant messaging app (like Slack) at first.
Here I publish my educational and pet-projects

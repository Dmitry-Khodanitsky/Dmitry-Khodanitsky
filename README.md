# Hello, my name is Dmitry Khodanitsky! 👋

## About me
I am a frontend developer. I completed the "Frontend Developer" course at [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/) and have worked on both commercial and educational projects - from Node.js CLI tools to full‑fledged SPA applications (including a Slack‑like messenger).  
My tech stack: React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, REST API, WebSocket, Vite, Git, CI/CD.  
Currently I contribute to the development of [Hexlet CV](https://cv.hexlet.io) - a service for IT specialists.

Previously I worked as a project curator and technical support specialist, which helps me see the real user behind the code and collaborate effectively within a team.
